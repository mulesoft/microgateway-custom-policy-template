# FAQ

**Which IDE should I use?**

There is no specific IDE for developing Rust. However, examples of available IDEs include:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

The Rust Programming Language book suggests the [rust-analyzer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html#ide-integration-using-rust-analyzer) plugin for Visual Studio Code. For IntelliJ, feel free to check the [Rust Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) available in their site.
